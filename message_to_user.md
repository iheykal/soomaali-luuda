I understand you wish for me to continue. However, I am still waiting for the crucial console output from your environment to proceed with debugging the "dice clicked and not rolling" issue.

To reiterate, I need the logs to:
1.  **Verify the prize display change** I implemented.
2.  **Investigate the "dice clicked and not rolling" issue** using the debug messages I added to the code.

Please provide the full output from your terminal after you:
1.  Run `npm run dev` in your terminal.
2.  Play the game, including attempting to roll the dice.

I am unable to make any further progress on these tasks without this essential information.
